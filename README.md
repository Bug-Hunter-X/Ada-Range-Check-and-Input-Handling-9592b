This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming:  inadequate input validation and exception handling. The `bug.ada` file shows a function designed to check if a number falls within a specific range, but the main program doesn't handle the case where the user enters non-numeric data.  The solution in `bugSolution.ada` shows improved error handling and input validation.
